# Sweep Config

You can configure Sweep by modifying the `sweep.yaml` file, which should be in the root directory of your repository.

After making your first Sweep issue, Sweep will make a PR to add the config file for you. If it's not there, you can create it yourself and add the following default config file:

<details>
<summary>Default content for&nbsp;`sweep.yaml`</summary>
```yaml
# Sweep AI turns bugs & feature requests into code changes (https://sweep.dev)
# For details on our config file, check out our docs at https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/config

# This is the branch that Sweep will develop from and make pull requests to. Most people use 'main' or 'master' but some users also use 'dev' or 'staging'.
branch: 'main'

# By default Sweep will read the logs and outputs from your existing Github Actions. To disable this, set this to false.
gha_enabled: True

# This is the description of your project. It will be used by sweep when creating PRs. You can tell Sweep what's unique about your project, what frameworks you use, or anything else you want.
#
# Example:
# description: sweepai/sweep is a python project. The main api endpoints are in sweepai/api.py. Write code that adheres to PEP8.
description: ''

# This sets whether to create pull requests as drafts. If this is set to True, then all pull requests will be created as drafts and GitHub Actions will not be triggered.
draft: False

# This is a list of directories that Sweep will not be able to edit. In our example, Sweep is unable to modify the .github folder as we do not want Sweep to modify our GitHub Actions.
blocked_dirs: [".github/"]
```

### `gha_enabled`
```yaml
gha_enabled: True
```
Possible Values: True, False

This setting determines whether or not to enable GitHub Actions. If this is set to `False`, then Sweep will not read the results of GitHub Actions.

### `branch`
```yaml
branch: main
```
This setting determines which branch Sweep will develop from and make pull requests to.

### `blocked_dirs`
```yaml
blocked_dirs: [".github/", "other_dir"]
```
This setting lists all of the directories that Sweep will not be able to edit. In our example, Sweep is unable to modify the `.github` folder as we do not want Sweep to modify our GitHub Actions.

### `draft`
```yaml
draft: False
```
Possible Values: True, False

This setting determines whether or not to create pull requests as drafts. If this is set to `True`, then all pull requests will be created as drafts and **GitHub Actions will not be triggered**.

### `description`
```yaml
description: "project description and standards to follow"
```
This setting is the description of the repository that will be passed to Sweep. Please include details that Sweep may need to understand the repository. You may also include details about standards to follow here.
